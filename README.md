## Project 1: Jen & Berry's
Jen and Berry’s is family-owned and run ice cream shop that works to create the most delicious treats, with locally sourced ingredients. Jen and Berry’s is working to expand their network and customer database by creating a website with good SEO (search engine optimization) so they can grow as a shop. The website will allow them to make edits to their menu, post about new events and catering opportunities, update their customers on recent Jen and Berry’s press, and receive customer feedback through a contact form. Jen and Berry have worked to cater their website to their audience, making it as user-friendly as possible to all ice cream lovers. Perhaps a next step for Jen and Berry’s would be to add an online ordering form to increase sales!
